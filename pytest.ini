    performance: marks tests as performance tests
    unit: marks tests as unit tests (no external dependencies)
    concurrent: marks tests that test concurrent browser operations
    browser: marks tests that require browser instances (should not run in parallel)
    quick: marks tests that run quickly without heavy browser operations
    order: marks test execution order (from pytest-order)
