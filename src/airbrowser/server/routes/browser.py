"""Browser lifecycle routes - DEPRECATED.

All browser operation routes are now auto-generated from BrowserOperations methods.
This file is kept for backwards compatibility but contains no routes.
See auto_browser_routes.py for the route generation logic.
"""

# This module is intentionally empty - all routes are auto-generated
# from BrowserOperations class in auto_browser_routes.py
